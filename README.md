# Game off 2023

[Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) is Github's annual game jam. It challenges individuals and teams to build a game during the month of November. The theme for this year is **scale**.

## Concept
In a 2D arena, defeat **waves of fish enemies** using various weapons that you'll gather during the game. Be careful though : you'll have to switch from one **scale plate** to another so that you don't drown into the dangerous water below.

## Tools

- [Krita](https://krita.org/)
