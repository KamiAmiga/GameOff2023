# Fish and Shift

[Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) is Github's annual game jam. It challenges individuals and teams to build a game during the month of November. The theme for this year is **scale**.

## Concept
In a 2D arena, defeat **the waves of your fish enemies**. Be careful though : you'll have to switch from one **scale plate** to another so that you don't drown into the dangerous water below.

## Tools
- [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/)
- [Krita](https://krita.org/)

## How to play
