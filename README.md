# Fish and Shift

[Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) is Github's annual game jam. It challenges individuals and teams to build a game during the month of November. The theme for this year is **scale**.

## Concept
In a 2D arena, defeat **the waves of your fish enemies**. Be careful though : you'll have to switch from one **scale plate** to another so that you don't drown into the dangerous water below.

## Tools
- [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/)
- [Krita](https://krita.org/)
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/)
- old fashioned pen and paper

## How to play
- Use "Left" and "Right" keys to move on the platforms
- Jump to the next scale plate with key "Up" when you reach its border
- Shoot bullets towards your cursor with left mouse button
- Store bonuses on one side of the balance with left mouse button. Those are left by the enemies when you kill them
- Use the bonuses you've stored using "Down" key
